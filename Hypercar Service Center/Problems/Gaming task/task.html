  <p>Little Niki played with toys and put them into a list to keep track of them.</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">toys = ['Marinet', 'Toby', 'Kitty']</code></pre> 
  <p>Then, she decided to add another toy, named "Chubby", after which she sorted the list. As a result, she got the following:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">['Toby', 'Kitty', 'Chubby', 'Marinet']</code></pre> 
  <p>Unfortunately, Nicky forgot to save the code. Restore it to get the same result!</p> 
  <p>The input you will get is a list of four toy names, including "Chubby". You should sort the list and print it. Pay attention to the sorting function!</p>
