  <p>Imagine that your friend wants to bake a huge apple pie, and he needs a lot of apples. He goes to the market, find a fruiterer and asks for apples. Your friend needs more than 202 apples. Help your friend!</p> 
  <p>Create a function called <code class="java">check()</code> which takes a string. First, check if the string is a digit. If it isn't, print the message <code class="java">"It is not a digit!"</code> Then, if it is, change the type of your input value to <code class="java">int</code> and check if the digit is more than <code class="java">202</code> or equal to <code class="java">202</code>. It it is, print the digit. Otherwise, print another message <code class="java">"There are less than 202 apples! You cheated on me!"</code></p> 
  <p>You don't need to take any input or call the function yourself.</p>
