  <p>Imagine you are at the stationery. You want to buy a cheap pencil, so you are looking for discounts. You have found some price labels. The first one is a standard price, the second one is a reduced price. You want to buy a pencil if the discount is more than 50%. </p> 
  <p>Write a function called <code class="java">discounts()</code> that takes two prices: the first one and the discounted one. If the discount is more than 50%, <strong>return</strong> the message: <code class="java">"I will buy it!"</code>. If it is less, use the <code class="java">assert</code> keyword.</p> 
  <p>You don't need to take any input or call the function yourself.</p>
