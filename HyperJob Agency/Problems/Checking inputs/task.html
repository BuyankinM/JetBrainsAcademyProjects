  <p>Imagine that you want to buy a present for your friend, but you have little money. You want to choose a present which costs more than 120 cents and less than 137 cents.</p> 
  <p>Implement a function called <code class="java">check()</code> which takes a digit as an argument. The function checks if the digit lies between <code class="java">120</code> and <code class="java">137</code>. If the input is expected, print it. If it is border or invalid, print the message <code class="java">"That's a bad present!"</code></p> 
  <p>You don't need to take any input or call the function yourself.</p>
